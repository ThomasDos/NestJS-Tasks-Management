# Task Management System with NestJS, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL

Welcome to the Task Management System project! This repository showcases a comprehensive solution for efficient task management, leveraging the power of modern technologies. Built with NestJS, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL, this project aims to streamline task organization, tracking, and collaboration.

## Features

- **GraphQL API:** Utilize a robust GraphQL API to interact with the task management system. GraphQL's flexible querying enables tailored requests for specific data, optimizing performance and minimizing over-fetching.

- **Database Persistence:** The project employs PostgreSQL as the database of choice, ensuring data integrity, reliability, and scalability. Store and manage task-related information efficiently.

- **NestJS Framework:** Built on the NestJS framework, the project benefits from its modular structure, dependency injection, and powerful middleware. This architecture promotes maintainability and extensibility.

- **Efficient Task Management:** Organize tasks effectively, assign priorities, set due dates, and track progress. This system provides a clear overview of tasks, enhancing productivity and collaboration.

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that only authorized users can access and modify task data.
